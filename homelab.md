### Getting Started
The only basic requirement to setting up a home lab is access to a computer. If you do not have access to one, you can use one of the many online resources for access to a lab. Check out the README.md for more information. A home pentest lab can mean differnet things. For me, it's a collection of virtual machines used for practice. Below is an image of the current machines I keep in my lab.

### Virtualization 
The two most popular virtualization tools for a home lab are VM Ware or Virtual box. Download these to your computer with the following links 

1. [VM Ware Fusion](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/info/slug/desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_fusion/11_0)
2. [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

With working virtualization software, you can now add machines to your lab. Keep in mind that most machines will be software specefic, if your downloading a machine built for virtualbox you should only import it there.

### Attack Machines
Now, download an attack machine. The most popular option is Kali Linux, but there are some other options as well. Find the links below

*Virtual Box Attack Machines*
1. [Kali Linux for Virtual Box](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/)
2. [Parrot Security for Virtual Box](https://parrotlinux.org/download-security.php)
3. [BlackArch Linux](https://blackarch.org/downloads.html)
4. 

*VM Ware Attack Machines*
1. [Kali Linux for VMware](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/)



### Target Machines

*Target Machines*
1. [Metasploitable](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/): This is one of the most popular target machines. It is purposfully built full of vulnerabilities. In contrast to most CTF machines, metasploitable has plenty of services up and running to play around with
