# thankitforward
A repository of tips and tricks I've learned as a means to thank forward all the help I've received in the tech space. I will continuously update this repo with the best resources, tools, and techniques I've learned along the way. If there are any questions feel free to reach out and I will try to get back as soon as time permits.
